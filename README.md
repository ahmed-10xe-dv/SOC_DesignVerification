## Introduction
The goal of this repository is to provide a comprehensive learning path for SoC design verification. It starts with basic verification concepts using Verilog and progresses to more advanced SystemVerilog topics. This structured approach helps you build a solid understanding of verification methodologies, culminating in the creation of layered testbenches for verifying complex designs.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized into the following directories:
- **Basic Concepts**: Covers fundamental topics in Verilog used for verification.
- **Advanced Concepts**: Focuses on SystemVerilog features that enhance verification, including object-oriented programming, assertions, and functional coverage.
- **Layered Testbench**: Demonstrates creating a layered verification environment using SystemVerilog, including driver, monitor, scoreboard, and generator components.

## Getting Started
To get started with the examples:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/araza8562/SOC_DesignVerification.git
